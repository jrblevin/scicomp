Summary: Fortran mandelbrot Jason Blevins 2010-04-09

Description:

The existing Fortran implementations of mandelbrot are giving "bad
output."  This seems to be due to some rounding issues, which this
version fixes by explicitly declaring a real kind parameter and using
it throughout to ensure that all calculations are carried out in
double precision.  This version also makes use of OpenMP for use
in the quad-core benchmarks, uses Fortran 95's bit twiddling
intrinsic functions, and tweaks some of the inner loop tests to
improve performance.
